## Project Overview
You will notice some things need to be updated in this code.
It was originally made with Java 8 and JUnit 4. 
The plan is for you to still use JUnit 4, but you can and should use a more recent version, like Java 21. 
You may also note a few other redundant things (e.g. imports). Fix whatever you need to.
